[Ten years ago Git was created](https://www.atlassian.com/git/articles/10-years-of-git/). Personally I only started using Git a couple of years ago, after one more year of experience with SVN, but I was a big change.

* how I worked with GIT (cool, various, low responsability)
    - Git is confortable. There is so much space for try and error without risk of compromising the entire project that the pressure is quite low and I liked that very much, above all at the beginning. The other aspect I appreciate is that the command-line tool is effective enough to avoid using GUI tools (see **aliases** section).
* how much time I spent in Git and shell
    - My Shell is my helm and I usually spent a lot of time both in Shell and GIT, so I need a good way to import information like **branch** and **tag** in my command shell.
* what I don't like in bash, the too long prompt when going down the path (and the fact that I prefer deep paths respect wide paths)
    - Default Shell in Linux is usually bash.
* Solution: Zsh and double prompt.
* Minimal prompt and...
* Fully informative prompt (that can disappear) for all the rest
* Git integration
    - informative prompt and branch
    - aliases
    - ghistory
