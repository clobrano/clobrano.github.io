In the last year I worked as Software Engineer for M2M devices, namely I dealed with modems and gps devices. On Linux, the tool I used the most has been [Minicom](http://linux.die.net/man/1/minicom), in order to connect and "talk" with those devices. Well, actually I did't really use Minicom a lot, since it misses some features I really like to have in a shell: command history, autocomplete, inline help.

Everyone that does this same job knows that **commands used for modems are not that easy to remember at the beginning** and that often they have to be **typed again and again frequently**. On Minicom there is no command history, so every time I need to type again the entire string, loosing time and making mistakes (another funny thing is that the system I work on might have different keyboard layouts, so the mistakes are really frequent and annoying) and there is no "man page".

All this story to say that, as a Python fan, I put togheter some libraries and a bit of free time to build a **Python package that provides a Minicom like shell with command history, autocomplete and inline help!** The library is called **Pynicom**, can be downloaded from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pynicom/0.3.1) or installed directly using [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/) and has a [github](https://github.com/clobrano/pynicom) page for anybody that wants to check the code, contribute or submit bugs and feature request (not all Minicom's features have been implemented yet).

The library is also integrated with [Raffaello](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/raffaello/2.2.0) (about which I will write another blog post sooner or later) which enables a sort of syntax highlighting, feature I introduced to save my eyes when digging into GPS (NMEA) stream of messages, colorizing only the messages I needed to see.

Hope you find it useful, bye!
