I read a blog post yesterday that is only the last example of a bad practice I saw often: disable authentication/security in applications because it is annoying to type the password every time. My point of view in those cases is **do not do it**. Not just because there is a reason to have such security layer - which is true BTW -, but because there are at least 2 better solutions:

1. The application provide an automatic authentication method, usually through GPG keys or encripted files
2. If the application does not provide it, you have a chance to contribute to the project in a really valuable way!

Of course here I am talking about open source projects, but most of the time that is the case of those tutorials/guides.
