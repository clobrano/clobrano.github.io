The Communitheme Team has just promoted the **edge** channel to **stable**!

This week update brings mainly bug fixes and some big and little details on:

- Context menu shadow in GNOME Nautilus,
- GNOME Terminal tabs,
- Headerbars and separation between focused and unfocused windows,
- Bright GNOME Shell dialog windows.

Anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme --edge
{% endhighlight %}
