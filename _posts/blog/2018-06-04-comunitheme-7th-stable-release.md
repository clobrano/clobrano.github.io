The first release of June and the first one one Monday brings the following updates

- New contextual menu style (hope you like it!)
- Improved check and radio button inactive style (light and dark version)
- Editable Text selection will have a go with blue again :)
- GNOME Shell popovers have improved colors and transparencies

and a lot of bug has been fixed as usual ;)

Anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.

snap install communitheme --edge
{% endhighlight %}
