This is probably a series of post on a topic which I take care a lot, how to optimize my study.

I like to study. This is a kind of bold statement I always find true, since I was a child. When my friends tell me how boring and annoying was the school for them, I think "I actually liked it". This makes me nerd, and probably other expressions I can't translate from italian, but the reality is that I don't really like "study" but I like "to know new things". Surely I didn't like much the hours spent study anything from math to story or philosophy, or the fact I couldn't go out to play football, and surely I didn't like tests, but I honestly enjoyed learning.
