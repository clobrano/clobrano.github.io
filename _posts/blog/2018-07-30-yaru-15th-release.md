The **Yaru team** is happy to announce a new stable release!

This is the first Communitheme/Yaru stable release after announcing the new name

This week update brings the following

- update the Snap information, package description and some more packaging fixes
- copyright fixes
- a new Login/Lock screen, which brings back the all-purple background, with an improved gradient
- alignment of gtk2 assets to the gtk3 ones

Anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme --edge
{% endhighlight %}
