The **Communitheme team** is happy to announce a new stable release!

It's the 13th stable release, but no one is superstitious right? :)

This week we worked mainly on bug fixes, clean up and in some background activities regarding the repositories and some more :)

Anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme --edge
{% endhighlight %}
