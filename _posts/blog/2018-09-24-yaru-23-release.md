The **Yaru team** is happy to announce a new stable release!

![yaru-release-pic](/images/ubuntu-yaru.png)

The changes are mainly bug fixes:

- align notebook tab labels
- added a margin to usb-creator's dialog to fix Geary headerbar
- improved visibility of selected partitions in GNOME disk
- made osd_borders_color brighter in shell to improve visibility on dark backgrounds
- fixed circular button border in Nautilus (the stop loading folder button)
- fixes in rhythmbox
- updates in build scripts


Yaru is already default theme in **Cosmic Cuttlefish 18.10**, so if you like to try it, please report any feedback on the [Ubuntu HUB](https://community.ubuntu.com/t/call-for-participation-an-ubuntu-default-theme-lead-by-the-community) or on our [Github repository](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru).

If you want to try it on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop), install the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software or from SHELL using the following command

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme
{% endhighlight %}

This will install the **stable** Snap package, which will be automatically updated ~each week, but if you want to try immediately any new change, install from the *edge* channel.

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme --edge
{% endhighlight %}


A [Yaru inspired Firefox theme](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAALtAAAAAAAAAABBKYhm849SCiazH1KEGccwS-xNVAWBveAusLC2VAlvlSjJ6UJSeqAgCYbdwa_-rV70IROd68eEot6ey6DBD6clRBXp1e7Wbm3jkhhZsTB6iGtxUNA9rD_f7WkYu4v4RFB_XR74DFyPAFWYVQkUMNbL2Mo2sQa9jDMc35kqQOoJm4_aT6Dkc9xrEV6O_-5hkDwOlMzIcFLFRtRxRaGEyH-y4Be72Vgc9j_f_vkOgA) is available, but, please consider that *this is not part of Communitheme official release*.
