The **Communitheme team** is happy to announce a new stable release!

The first stable release of July

- improves entry widget on headerbar
- begins a new style journey, this time about toolbar buttons (this to say that current version is not going to stay)
- adds a new improvement in Nemo support, with a better style of Places sidebar (more coming)

and our bug fixes.

Anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme --edge
{% endhighlight %}
