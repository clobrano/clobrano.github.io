The **Communitheme team** is happy to announce a new stable release!

This week brings one of the major updates since a lot of time:

- A new sidebar/mainview color set, hope you like it as we do
- A back to the future change for text selection
- A subtle restyle for (disabled) switch
- A unified style for radio and check buttons
- No more dashed line when scrolling (e.g. in Nautilus), but a nice shadow (easier to see than to write)
- Beautified emoji-picker popover style, thanks to a new contributor ;)

And probably the minor number of bugs than ever :D


Moreover a **little bonus for Firefox users**.
Thanks to [Firefox Test pilot](https://testpilot.firefox.com/), I "developed" (it was too easy) a [Communitheme inspired Firefox theme](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAALtAAAAAAAAAABBKYhm849SCiazH1KEGccwS-xNVAWBveAusLC2VAlvlSjJ6UJSeqAgCYbdwa_-rV70IROd68eEot6ey6DBD6clRBXp1e7Wbm3jkhhZsTB6iGtxUNA9rD_f7WkYu4v4RFB_XR74DFyPAFWYVQkUMNbL2Mo2sQa9jDMc35kqQOoJm4_aT6Dkc9xrEV6O_-5hkDwOlMzIcFLFRtRxRaGEyH-y4Be72Vgc9j_f_vkOgA). Please, consider that *this is not part of Communitheme in any way*, it is just a toy I had fun to do.


As usual, anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme --edge
{% endhighlight %}
