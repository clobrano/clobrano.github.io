In the past two years, I built a corpus of well documented and reusable bash scripts for both my main work and my sideprojects.

This is how it happened.

A couple of years ago I went through a long period were writing many scripts was the only way to help me at work.

Testing some modems and command line utilities, I needed to group many commands at once to, as example, establish a full data connection.

Honestly, my scripts were really hard to reuse, and months after writing them, always took me time to understand the meaning of all the variables in place.

The main problems where:

1. no usage/help message: I was forced to dig into the code to see what it was supposed to do
2. no flexibility: no options and instead hard-coded values, so the script was able to do only one specific thing

I remembered the python library [Docopt](http://docopt.org/), which just reading the help message, can provide all the
command line options you define, so I looked for a similar project for bash scripting and I [found one](https://github.com/docopt/docopts).

At that time **Docopts** was written in Python (now it is written in go), but the problem was that I prefer to avoid
dependencies in my scripts. In python you have the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) and it is perfectly
normal to install a python script. For bash, at least from my point of view, I prefer that each script depends
only on the commands it calls, not on other scripts for extended functionalities.

So I wrote [CLInt](https://github.com/clobrano/CLInt), a CLI generator from the help message... ehm... so, what's the difference?

CLInt works at **writing time**, it auto-generates all the bash code needed to parse the command line options, that
can be simply *copy&pasted* in the script itself, very easy.

I then added some sweets:

- if [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) is installed, CLInt's output is available in system clipboard as well
- if you use **VIM**, the following configuration is enough to paste CLInt's output directly into the script without the need of a terminal.

        command! CLInt r !/path/to/CLInt/clint.sh -s %

This - unexpectedly at the beginning - totally changed the quality of my scripts, and it was not because I became a better Bash developer.

All my scripts started to be well documented **just because** documentation was the only thing I needed to have options and flexibility, and it was super easy and fast to do it (especially on VIM).

CLInt development has stopped some time ago, because it already satisfies all my needs, but it is still young and far from perfect, so I hope that some more people will try it and help me find all the bugs hidden in the project.


NOTE: For VIM/Neovim users, the following configuration will call CLInt on the current buffer, without the hassle to close the file, open a shell and call CLInt on the file.

    command! CLInt r !~/path/to/CLInt/clint.sh -s %
