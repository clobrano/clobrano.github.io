The **Yaru team** is happy to announce a new stable release.

Being the first stable version since Cosmic Cuttlefish release, the change is quite big, here are the most interesting changes:

- Styled Nautilus pathbar filter tags for 3.30 leap
- made the style of Stackswitcher and Buttonbox the same
- New desktop Icon and some more icons
- Made virtual keyboard in Yaru style
- Renewed infobar

This changes will be available on snap only.

If you want to try it on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop), install the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software or from SHELL using the following command

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme
{% endhighlight %}

This will install the **stable** Snap package, which will be automatically updated ~each week, but if you want to try immediately any new change, install from the *edge* channel.

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme --edge
{% endhighlight %}
