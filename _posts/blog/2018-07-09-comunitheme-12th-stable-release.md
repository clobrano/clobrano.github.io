The **Communitheme team** is happy to announce a new stable release!

During the first week of July we:

- improved Nemo experience, as promised ;)
- refreshed alt-tab switcher and some colors
- reviewed toolbar buttons style (hover effect)
- fixed some bugs in Nautilus and Gnome Terminal (backdrop and tabs)

there are also some important works in progress, but unfortunately they did not make it for this release :)

Anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme --edge
{% endhighlight %}
