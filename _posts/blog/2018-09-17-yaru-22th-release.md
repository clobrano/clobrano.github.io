The **Yaru team** is happy to announce a new stable release!

![yaru-release-pic](/images/ubuntu-yaru.png)

This is a small release to resync with the usual Monday release scheduling.

Here the changes since last release

- fixed entry on headerbar
- fixed notebook tabs in Nautilus
- fixes in build scripts

Yaru is already default theme in **Cosmic Cuttlefish 18.10**, so if you like to try it, please report any feedback on the Ubuntu HUB or on our Github repository.

If you want to try it on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop), install the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software or from SHELL using the following command

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme
{% endhighlight %}

This will install the **stable** Snap package, which will be automatically updated ~each week, but if you want to try immediately any new change, install from the *edge* channel.

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme --edge
{% endhighlight %}


A [Yaru inspired Firefox theme](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAALtAAAAAAAAAABBKYhm849SCiazH1KEGccwS-xNVAWBveAusLC2VAlvlSjJ6UJSeqAgCYbdwa_-rV70IROd68eEot6ey6DBD6clRBXp1e7Wbm3jkhhZsTB6iGtxUNA9rD_f7WkYu4v4RFB_XR74DFyPAFWYVQkUMNbL2Mo2sQa9jDMc35kqQOoJm4_aT6Dkc9xrEV6O_-5hkDwOlMzIcFLFRtRxRaGEyH-y4Be72Vgc9j_f_vkOgA) is available, but, please consider that *this is not part of Communitheme official release*.
