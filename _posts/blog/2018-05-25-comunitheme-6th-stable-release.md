New stable release of communitheme is ready!

This week most of our effort went to the “wall of dark” issue, so this release bring a new iteration of panel/dock color and several bug fixes

Anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.

snap install communitheme --edge
{% endhighlight %}
