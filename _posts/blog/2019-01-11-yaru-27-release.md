Here the main content:

* GTK2 dark (finally), this means that you can select a complete Yaru-dark now!
* New wonderful symbolic icons
* New colorful icons (Firefox, Printer, Help, USB hard disk, Podcast, Packages and more)
* Amplified sounds
* Fixed Firefox dark theme checkmarks and other bug fixing

This changes will be available on snap only.

If you want to try it on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop), install the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software or from SHELL using the following command

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme
{% endhighlight %}

This will install the **stable** Snap package, which will be automatically updated at each stable release, but if you want to try immediately any new change, install from the *edge* channel.
