In the process of moving from vim to neovim, looking for improved plugin managers that the new version of vim could have created, I found [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

I was not very keen in changing the plugin manager (Vundle) at the beginning, because I was afraid that it would mess up my configuration, but something in **vim-plug** convinced me.

Vim-plug is defined in its github page as a "Minimalist Vim Plugin Manager", but even if very simple to set up (actually a little easier that Vundle), vim-plug offers some new appealing features, one above all "on-demand loading" of plugins.

{% highlight vim %}
" NERD tree will be loaded on the first invocation of NERDTreeToggle command
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree', { 'on': 'NERDTreeToggle' }

" Code to execute when the plugin is loaded on demand
Plug 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe', { 'for': 'cpp' }
autocmd! User YouCompleteMe if !has('vim_starting') | call youcompleteme#Enable() | endif
{% endhighlight %}

Other intersting things are described in its Github [page](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) (e.g. parallel plugin download/update) have a look a them, I am very happy to have had the time to move to vim-plug.
