The **Yaru team** is happy to announce the second stable release of 2019.

Here the main content:



If you want to try it on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop), install the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software or from SHELL using the following command

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme
{% endhighlight %}

This will install the **stable** Snap package, which will be automatically updated at each stable release, but if you want to try immediately any new change, install from the *edge* channel.

{% highlight bash %}
snap install communitheme --edge
{% endhighlight %}
