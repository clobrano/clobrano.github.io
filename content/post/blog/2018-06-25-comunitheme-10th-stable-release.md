title: Communitheme 10th stable release
---

The **Communitheme team** is happy to announce a new stable release and we reached double digit release 10!

This week update brings the following:

- Re-introduced hover effects on out-of-focus (or backdrop) windows
- Initial updates on GTK2 theme to make it as similar as possible to our GTK3 main theme
- Again light blue for selected text.
- Bug fixes!

A [Communitheme inspired Firefox theme](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAALtAAAAAAAAAABBKYhm849SCiazH1KEGccwS-xNVAWBveAusLC2VAlvlSjJ6UJSeqAgCYbdwa_-rV70IROd68eEot6ey6DBD6clRBXp1e7Wbm3jkhhZsTB6iGtxUNA9rD_f7WkYu4v4RFB_XR74DFyPAFWYVQkUMNbL2Mo2sQa9jDMc35kqQOoJm4_aT6Dkc9xrEV6O_-5hkDwOlMzIcFLFRtRxRaGEyH-y4Be72Vgc9j_f_vkOgA) is available, but, please consider that *this is not part of Communitheme official release*.

As usual, anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.
