title: Yaru 17th stable release
---

The **Yaru team** is happy to announce a new stable release!

Quite a full week of changes the last one, here's the list:

- button-box (e.g. Gnome Software) took a dedicated style, instead of mimic stack switcher. This was necessary to avoid problems with complex button-box hierarchies.
- cleaner default button indication
- improved Ubitquity style for a cleaner experience installing the next Ubuntu 18.10
- fixed switches color in GDM (this was from a new contributor :+1:)
- better backdrop infobar
- better backdrop borders in dark version
- stop loading button in Nautilus (when loading big folders) is now neat and visible
- fixes on GDM entries and button
- fixed selection ring transition in combobox entry+button


Anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.

{{< highlight bash >}}
snap install communitheme --edge
