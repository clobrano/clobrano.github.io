title: Reading habit in 2015
---

For the second year in a row, I traced all the books I read this year. I have a fancy Google sheet where I write down start and end date along with the title and the book's author, just for the pleasure to have some data about my reading habit<a rel="nofollow" href="#footnote1" id="ref_footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

It turned out that I read 17 books, 2 less than the past year, most of them were novels, while the year before I read also technical books about software, psychology and personal improvement. Not that I stopped reading technical stuff, but it was mostly on the Internet, like blogs and videos. Reading tech books is a habit I would like to take again this year.

This year I started listening to audio books (5 out of 17 and I am still listening to one now), that, along with the fact that I changed job and my commute time has increased by the double, let me enjoy quite a lot of stories I would not be able to read otherwise. In fact, audio books convinced me so much, that I just subscribed for the 30-days-free trial of [Audible](http://www.audible.com/), and I am in the process of exploring interesting new titles.

I also came back to paper books. I am not in the battle e-book v.s. "real" books, since I really like both and for different reasons, but this year lot of the books I read were gifts and in paper format. Sure enough, if the kindle were able to read my e-books<a rel="nofollow" href="#footnote2" id="ref_footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>, it would be a killer app for me.

1. Well I am an engineer after all, I like data<a rel="nofollow" href="#ref_footnote1" id="footnote1">[↩]</a>.
2. Kindle is kind of able to read books, but the functionality is really basic, one can not even stop and restart from a bookmark for example.<a rel="nofollow" href="#ref_footnote2" id="footnote2">[↩]</a>.
