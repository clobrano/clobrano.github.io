The **Communitheme team** is happy to announce a new stable release!

This week we worked mainly on

- completed the transition to the unique repository for all Communitheme compontents
- added the AUTHORS file, to recognize the people who contributed the most. **NOTE:** if you don't like to appear in the list, or you prefer to appear with a different name and/or email, please let us know).
- back to GNOME upstream grid icon (we will work in the background to provide an alternative, but for now we go upstream)
- more bug fixes as usual!


Anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.
