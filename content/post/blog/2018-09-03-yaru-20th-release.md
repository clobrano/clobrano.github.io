title: Yaru 20th stable release
---

The **Yaru team** is happy to announce a new stable release!

This week we made a lot of improvements on the dark variant, let us know your opinion ;)

- checked buttons in headerbar, dialog, notification and hotplug fully flat
- reduced differences from upstream to simplify future upgrades
- improved dark and light radio/check buttons backdrop and insensitive states
- improved dark Nautilus tabs (as well generic notebook tabs), in order to make it more similar to Gnome-terminal
- Suru Icon refresh
- improved dark pathbar

Anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.

{{< highlight bash >}}
snap install communitheme --edge
