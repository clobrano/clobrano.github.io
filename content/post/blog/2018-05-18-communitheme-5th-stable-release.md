title: Communitheme 5th stable release

New stable release of communitheme is ready!

- Folders will be less distracting when Nautilus is not on focus :)
- Added style for Nemo file explorer
- GNOME Terminal as improved a little again
- more bugs have been fixed

Moreover, you're going to see again fully opaque top panel and dock when a window is maximized. We discussed a lot this decision. We liked the transparency as many of you do, but it is needed to fix a weird [problem of overlay](https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-communitheme/issues/173).

However we are working hard to try to bring back the transparency we had before, so, hopefully this is not the end :)

Anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.

{{< highlight bash >}}
snap install communitheme --edge
