title: I am going to GUADEC 2019
---

This was way more than unexpected, but I'm going to attend Gnome's [GUADEC](https://2019.guadec.org/) conference this year!

> GUADEC brings together Free Software enthusiasts and professionals from all over the world. Join us for six days of talks, demos, discussion, parties, games and more.

Being just a kind of hobbyist contributor, I wasn't thinking about joining any conference.
I mean, dreaming about it yes, but not actually planning for it.

My gratitude goes to **Canonical and the Ubuntu Community** that sponsored me for this awesome opportunity, I never expected that the [Yaru](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru) project would have given me more than a wonderful looking desktop ðŸ˜‰. 

This year, GUADEC is held in **Thessaloniki, Greece, between the 23rd and 28th of August**, with the usual three days of conferences, followed by three other days of workshops.

I will be an enthusiast guest most of the time, but I'll also participate in the [Vendor Themes](https://wiki.gnome.org/GUADEC/2019/Hackingdays/VendorThemes) workshop the 27th.

I'm looking forward to meet - finally in person - the many people that helped me online during these years and some new ones.

See you there!

Carlo
