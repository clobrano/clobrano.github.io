title: Yaru 16th stable release
---

The **Yaru team** is happy to announce a new stable release!

This week update brings the following

- sync with upstream content
- updates necessary to be default theme in next release (+1)
- improved Nautilus secondary label color
- reduced icon size in GTK2 (except in the toolbar, to keep it aligned with GTK3)
- completed the alignment of our slider set to a shared style

Anyone on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) can try the theme installing the [snap](https://snapcraft.io/communitheme) package from GNOME Software.
Stable Snap package will be automatically updated each week, but if you want to try immediatly any new change install from the *edge* channel.

{{< highlight bash >}}
